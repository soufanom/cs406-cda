# Hint: Use numpy's np.random.rand() function to generate 50 data points for x and y.
# Replace the None with your code.

# Exercise 2: Calculate the element-wise difference between x and y
# Hint: Simply subtract y from x.
# Replace the None with your code.

# Exercise 3: Calculate the mean of the x coordinates
# Replace the None with your code.

# Exercise 4: Find the maximum value in the y coordinates

# Replace the None with your code.

# Exercise 6: Reshape the concatenated array to a 2x50 2D array
# Hint: Use np.reshape() on the concatenated array.
# Replace the None with your code.
